# Baselang is a language for describing how things work.

Baselang is a language for describing how things work.

This crate provides an embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) for modeling and type-checking concepts in a way that’s both precise and expressive.

### Core Concepts

* **Types**: Represented by [`Typ`][__link0], which can be top-level types [`Top`][__link1], expression types [`One`][__link2],
  or function types [`Fun`][__link3].
* **Expressions**: Represented by [`Exp`][__link4], which can be variables [`Sol`][__link5] or applications [`App`][__link6].
* **Variables**: Represented by [`Var`][__link7], which have names and types.
* **Modules**: Collections of related variables, like [`Bool`][__link8], [`List`][__link9], and [`Nat`][__link10].
* **Type Checking**: Enforced at construction time to ensure type-safety across the language.

### Features

* Static type checking at compile time and runtime
* Composable modules that model foundational concepts
* Macros for concise expression construction
