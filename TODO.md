* Add intro
  * Continuous change
    * Our experience is continuous - some things don't change. But the same experience tells us that other things change. This duality gives rise to the idea of "continuous change" - a transformation that maintains some properties while changing the others. And the most fundamental continuity is the continuity itself - the fact that "some things don't change" doesn't change.
* Update positioning
  * Most people don't have a problem with making decisions, but they do have a problem with persuading other people about correctness of their decisions.
* Process knowledge
  * If you can't detect the cycles in the sequence, then it's not valid to use the axiom of the cycle, because the current sequence may be only a part of the cycle
