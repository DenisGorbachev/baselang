# Value proposition

Baselang is a language for building context for LLMs.

Modern LLMs have long context windows. For example, Gemini 2.5 Pro can ingest 1'000'000 tokens (to be extended to 2'000'000 in the future).

Long contexts can hold more precise specifications.

## Notes

* Language is a set of rules for describing reality.
* Language is a set of rules for modelling physical objects.
* Language is a set of rules for painting with words.

Implications:

* Language splits the descriptions into "right" and "wrong"
  * For example, "Mary had a little lamb" is "right", while "Mary a had little lamb" is "wrong" in English language.
